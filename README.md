# ðŸ’¸ Dodgy Daveâ€™s

Dodgy Daveâ€™s is a simple stock prediction tool. It pulls the last 3 days of stock data from [Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) and runs it through OpenAI to give you plain-English insights.

Itâ€™s lightweight, runs in your browser, and doesnâ€™t need any fancy frameworks. Just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
